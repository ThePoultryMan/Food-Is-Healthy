## StackEdit
[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) is an online Markdown editor. Most of this site was written in Markdown (Which you can find here) and the rest was written with the help of BootStrap.

## \<zero-md>
[\<zero-md>](https://zero-md.github.io) is a markdown displayer that turns the Markdown that I write into HTML. This makes the website as a whole a lot easier to create.
